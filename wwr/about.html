            <p>Rafting has its roots in the need to navigate whitewater for exploration and trade. Originating in the wild rivers of North America and New Zealand, modern rafting evolved from the log rafts used by pioneers. As navigation techniques improved, rafting became an exciting adventure sport in the 1970s. It quickly spread around the world, attracting enthusiasts and tourists alike. Today, rafting is not only an exciting activity, but also a way to connect with nature and experience camaraderie through tumultuous waters.</p>
